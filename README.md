# multimodel-dotnet-quickstart

The QuickStart can be found at [https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Multimodel](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Multimodel)
It shows object, relational, and native access from a .NET application to InterSystems IRIS. 
Airport data is stored using objects, retrieved using SQL, and a custom data structure is created using the Native API to handle route information between airports.

## How to run:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the `quickstarts-multimodel-dotnet.sln` in Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. In `multimodelQS.cs` file, change username, password, IP, port and namespace to point to your instance of InterSystems IRIS.
4. Run code to see objects and SQL working side-by-side.
 
**NOTE:** We recommend to use **Microsoft Visual Studio** to run .NET Multimodel QuickStart code.
